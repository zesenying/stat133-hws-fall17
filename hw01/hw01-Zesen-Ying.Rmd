## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}

#From the scatterplots, does Experience seem to be related with Salary?
```{r}
#The scattorplot3d definitely shows that 


#From the scatterplots, does Experience seem to be related with Salary?
#Not really, but players with little experience tend to have less salary. However, players who has a lot of experience don't seem to earn as much as players who are in the prime years (5-10) years of experience. 
#From the boxplot, does Position seem to be related with Salary?
#Not really, but more centers tend to have higher salary.

# comments and reflections
1. To determine the types of data and when to use what type. I saw this in class, but when I did the hw I have to think about the when to use what type by myself.
2. Calculations
3. If this was my first time using git, then it was pretty hard for me
4. I encountered many problems.
5. Yes, I needed help. I searched on the Internet on how to use certain functions.
6. I spent more than 10 hours. I accidentally didn't save the file once
7. Figuring out what I did wrong that caused errors.
8. Yes, my regression line is not showing up.
9. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out why my regression line is not showing up
10. I found an error which is I made salary_in_mil a character and couldn't use it in the last part, so I had to convert it.
