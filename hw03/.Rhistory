#Not really, but players with little experience tend to have less salary. However, players who has a lot of experience don't seem to earn as much as players who are in the prime years (5-10) years of experience.
#From the boxplot, does Position seem to be related with Salary?
#Not really, but more centers tend to have higher salary.
