## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

1. The hard part is the preprocessing of data, I always have trouble on that.
2. the easy part is the calculation
3. Yes, I googled.
4. 5 hours
5. the most comsuming part is the preprocessing of the data
6. I didn't really understand about the baser and readr.
7. Don't know some structure of the how the function needed to be used.
8the exciting part is I finally know what EFF means because I have heard of it a lot but never knew what exactly that was.
