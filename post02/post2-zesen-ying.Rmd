## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot



```{r}
#while taking stat134, I learned about normal distribution, binomial distribution and poisson distribution
#this time I want to use R to see how random numbers generated by these three distributions are distributed and how close are these numbers that are randomly generated 
#in order to better visualize this, I will use the package 'rgl'
#RGL is a 3D real-time rendering system for R. Multiple windows are managed at a time. 
library("rgl")

```


```{r}
#5000 numbers randomly generated by a normal distribution
#with mean=0 and standard deviation=1

graph1<- rnorm(5000,0,1)

#now I use seq() to divide the 5000 numbers generated by the normal distribution
#and then I aline these three groups to x-axis y-axis and z-axis so that it is easier to visualize

x <- graph1[seq(1, length(graph1), 3)]
y<- graph1[seq(2, length(graph1), 3)]
z<- graph1[seq(3, length(graph1), 3)]
#created a lim function to limit the maximum value and the min value of something based on the value of the input
lim <- function(x){c(-max(abs(x)), max(abs(x))) * 1.3}
#now importing the rgl package
rgl.open()

rgl.bg(color="white")# background color
#use spheres to represent each number generated
rgl.spheres(x, y, z, r = 0.5, color = "lightblue")

#now create x,y,z axises, with each axis limited by 1.3 times of its max and min values
#different colors each axis and with the line thickness of 2
rgl.lines(lim(x), c(0, 0), c(0, 0), lw=2, color = "black")
rgl.lines(c(0, 0), lim(y), c(0, 0), lw=2, color = "red")
rgl.lines(c(0, 0), c(0, 0), lim(z), lw=2, color = "blue")
grid3d(c("x", "y", "z"))
#does it show on markdown file?
#if not, would you please run it and a window will pop up

#as we can see, the numbers are pretty close to the origin with approximately a mean of 0


```





```{r}
graph2<- rbinom(5000,100,0.5)
#try again with random number generated by a binomial distribution 
x <- graph2[seq(1, length(graph2), 3)]
y<- graph2[seq(2, length(graph2), 3)]
z<- graph2[seq(3, length(graph2), 3)]

lim <- function(x){c(-max(abs(x)), max(abs(x))) * 1.3}

rgl.open()
rgl.bg(color="white")
rgl.spheres(x, y, z, r = 0.5, color = "lightblue")

rgl.lines(c(0, 0), c(0, 0), lim(z),  lw=2, color = "blue")
grid3d(c("x", "y", "z"))
#as we can see, the numbers are pretty close to the mean, with is 100*0.5=50, the numbers are distributed along the mean, and there are a few exceptions where some numbers are pretty for from the mean.

```


```{r}
graph3<- rpois(5000,10)
#again with poison distribution
x <- graph3[seq(1, length(graph3), 3)]
y<- graph3[seq(2, length(graph3), 3)]
z<- graph3[seq(3, length(graph3), 3)]

lim <- function(x){c(-max(abs(x)), max(abs(x))) * 1.3}

rgl.open()
rgl.bg(color="white")
rgl.spheres(x, y, z, r = 0.5, color = "lightblue")
rgl.lines(lim(x), c(0, 0), c(0, 0), lw=2,color = "black")
rgl.lines(c(0, 0), lim(y), c(0, 0), lw=2, color = "red")
rgl.lines(c(0, 0), c(0, 0), lim(z), lw=2, color = "blue")
grid3d(c("x", "y", "z"))
#numbers generated by poisson distribution are also distributed along mean; however , there are few exceptions. And the exceptions are more likely to appear on one side of the graph.
```


```{r}

#overall, I think the numbers distributed by the normal distribution is probably better than the numbers by the other two because the other two tend to have more exceptions from the norm.
```
